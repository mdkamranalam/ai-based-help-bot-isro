# ISRO Chatbot

## Overview
The ISRO Chatbot is a web-based application designed to provide detailed information about the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) missions. Built for a hackathon, it leverages a knowledge graph, natural language processing (NLP), and a large language model (LLM) to answer queries about ISROâ€™s lunar, communication, interplanetary, and other missions. Key features include a dynamic knowledge graph visualization, a user-friendly Flask interface, and robust query handling for mission details, successes, and failures.
